# YanDevDiscordBotDecompilation
Yandere Dev, he has a Discord server and that server has bots. And the source code for those bots were leaked but there were some compiled Python code. So I decided to decompile it all so others don't have to. Unfortunately, some of the decompiled code is broken (usually files with -38 at the end) but the important ban/delete filters are perfectly fine, if maybe a little outdated.
